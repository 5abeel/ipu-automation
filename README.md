# IPU Automation Suite

This repository automates the provisioning, deployment, and image management for Intel IPU-based lab infrastructures across multiple nodes. It offers scripted and Ansible-based workflows for multi-hop, chained SSH environments often found in labs.

## What does this do?

- Automatically copies, extracts, and updates system images (such as `saiserver`, `imc-config`, and `debug-cli`) for IPU hosts, Link Partners, Management Consoles, and Compute nodes.
- Enables secure file transfers and remote update tasks, even in networks where each node is only accessible from the previous node in the chain.
- Facilitates reliable firmware and image deployment matching the required network topology for IPU testbeds and clusters.


## Features

- **Automated System Image Management:** Copy, extract, and deploy updates with minimal manual intervention.
- **Multi-Hop SSH Automation:** Handles chained connections and execution, ensuring updates are seamless.
- **Consistency and Repeatability:** Ensures reliable updates and reproducible results for lab and production IPU deployments.


## Topology

*Assumption*: The Link Partner is connected directly to IMC via 100.0.0.x network (100.0.0.1 on Link Partner (LP) and 100.0.0.100 on IMC). The automation scripts in this repository use the LP for installation and image management.

Option 1:

- The user runs these scripts on a local control-node with direct access to the Host and Link Partner.

                |                           |                       |

                |   |        |          |   |               |               |

                +---------------------------+
```

Option 2: These scripts can also execute directly on the LP. Use `localhost` for the LP node in the hosts.yml file.

                |           HOST            |                       
                |                           |

## Requirements

- Bash and SSH access on all target nodes.
- Ansible (for playbooks) with passwordless SSH setup where needed.
- Availability of all required system images.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository on your local machine (control node).
2. Update `group_vars`, `inventory` and connection details for your specific topology.

    - `cp group_vars/vault.yml.example group_vars/vault.yml` -> add your CI credentials to the vault.yml file.
    - `cp inventory/hosts.yml.example inventory/hosts.yml` -> add your Host and LP IP addresses, usernames and passwords to the hosts.yml file.

3. Run the provided scripts or Ansible playbooks to push updates as needed.
```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/ipu_setup.yml
```
